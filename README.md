# yogaSite

Overview: My mum wants to have her own yoga business someday. Or not. She can't make her mind up yet. Anyways, I'm making her
a site so that if she does choose to start a business, she can start quickly with a website ready to handle orders and 
to advertise times and prices. 

Tech that will be used in the project: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrapper, JQuery, SQL. Maybe PHP? 

Scope:

HTML/CSS pages:
1. Overview
2. Price 
3. Log in page (when logged in, can book appts and see appts). 
4. About me page. 

Back end:
1. SQL database to handle orders
2.

Finish readme.
